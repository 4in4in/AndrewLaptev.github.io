### Software module for localization of owners of digital assistants according to mobile device data

**Link to GitHub repository:** [BLight](https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_mobile)

This mobile application is designed for manual wireless control of several nearby smart lamps at once in a certain area of action, which is set by the user. The ESP 32 microcontroller with firmware [BLightESP32](https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_esp32) is used as the control controller of the lamp. The control is carried out by changing the color temperature of the lamps, as well as their brightness.

In the future, it is possible to develop the application towards automating the selection of the light mode for the user. This can be done, for example, through API interaction with the user's digital profile, which can transmit to the application the necessary data about switching light modes that are currently most suitable for the user

### Software module for normalization of the psycho-emotional state and personalization of the environment through artificial lighting

**Link to GitHub repository:** [BLightESP32](https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_esp32)

This application allows you to control the color temperature and brightness of the LED lamp via PWM. Management is carried out through the mobile application [BLight](https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_mobile) via Bluetooth Low Energy.

In the future, it is possible to develop the service towards automating the selection of the light mode for the user. This can be done, for example, through API interaction mobile application with the user's digital profile, which can transmit to the application the necessary data about switching light modes that are currently most suitable for the user
