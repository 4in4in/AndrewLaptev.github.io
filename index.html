<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Our project is aimed at stabilizing the psycho-emotional state of users through the personalization of artificial lighting in space. The determination of the psycho-emotional state is based on data from the ecosystem of digital assistants. The project consists of three software modules.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<p>It is necessary to use the software created within the framework of the project to personalize artificial lighting when using multiple lamps by several users at the same time. It is also important to note that you can change the lighting parameters at will, and taking into account data about your psycho-emotional state.</p>
<h3 id="for-whom">For whom</h3>
<p>This software is necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who want to improve or stabilize their psychoemotional state</li>
<li>users who have adjustable lamps or light sources who want to personalize their lighting (especially if several people want to change lighting settings)</li>
<li>employers who want to increase the efficiency of employees and reduce the fatigue of their employees</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-modules">Software modules</h2>
<p>The project consists of three software modules (each of which performs its own highly specialized tasks) to stabilize and normalize the psycho-emotional state of users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Software module for localization of owners of digital assistants according to mobile device data</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_mobile">BLight</a>) - performs the tasks of determining the user&#39;s location to find the nearest light sources so that the user controls the nearest lamps to him</li>
<li><strong>Software module for normalization of the psycho-emotional state and personalization of the environment through artificial lighting</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_esp32">BLightESP32</a>) - performs the tasks of controlling lighting parameters through changes in color temperature and luminous flux of the lamp</li>
<li><strong>Software module for recognizing a psychoemotional state based on data from the ecosystem of digital assistants</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/TimurSamigulin/core-emotion">CoreEmotion</a>)</li>
</ul>
